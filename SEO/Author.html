        Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642  20 March 1726/27[a]) 
        was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, 
        theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher.
        He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. 
        His pioneering book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica 
        (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, 
        consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.
        Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, 
        and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating 
        infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.

        Newton's work on calculus was done in the late 1660s and early 1670
        Newton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665.
        In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation 
        and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. 
        This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, 
        who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society,[79] 
        and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from 
        Newton to Royal Society transactions
